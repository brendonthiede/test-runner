# TestRunner

## Purpose

This project sets up some infrastructure for housing and retrieving test results, specifically intended for Protractor end-to-end tests using the `protractor-jasmine2-screenshot-reporter` plugin.
There is also an example script for running a test, uploading results, and sending a Slack message on failure.
